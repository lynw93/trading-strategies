This repository focuses on time-series forecasting using mid-frequency financial data, typically ranging from minute-level to daily intervals. The goal is to explore and implement predictive models—such as ARIMA, Kalman filters, and LSTMs — that are tailored to the unique characteristics of this frequency range, including noise, partial autocorrelation, and regime shifts.
